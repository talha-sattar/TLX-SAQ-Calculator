# NASA TLX Calculator + LB QuestionnaireLB


## 🚀 About the Project
This tool provides a streamlined interface for researchers and practitioners to collect and analyze two critical human factors metrics:
* **NASA Task Load Index (TLX):** For calculating subjective multi-dimensional workload.
* **Situation Awareness Questionnaire (SAQ/SART):** Based on the **Braarud (2021)** framework for assessing situation awareness and attentional demand.

The suite is built with a focus on sociolinguistic profiling and high-fidelity data collection, making it suitable for both academic research and industrial usability testing.
